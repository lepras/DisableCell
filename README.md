**currently bootloops the device**, just airplane mode with wifi on kind works though.

# Disable Cell

* Removes unnecessary apps (Messaging.apk, Dialer.apk, TelephonyProvider.apk, Mms.apk)
* Completely turns off cell radio on bootup
* Installs the radiooptions binary in case your ROM does not include it
* Prevents emergency calls and 911 calls (good for giving your kids your old phone to play with)

# Misc

Call *#*#4636#*#*, tap "Phone information" and (nearly at the bottom) tap the "Turn off radio" button
